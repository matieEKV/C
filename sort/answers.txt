sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Compared to other two sorters, it took the longest time to sort through all the lists.
Also, the time it took to go through the sorted list did not differ much from the other lists, leading me to conclude
that its omega is same as the big O - ruling bubble sort out.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: This sorter was by far the fastest of all. Also, running time going though sorted list did not differ much
from other lists, once again showing that omega is the same as the big O.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: This sorter was faster than the first but slower than second, leading me to believe it is using the bubble sort.
However, the determining factor was running time for the sorted list - it was shorter than others. Since bubble sort has
omega(n), it should go quick through the already sorted list.
